/**
 * A server that can handle {@link Client} connections. Internally it matches a client connection
 * to a {@link Client} constructed from an {@link com.damnvulnerableapp.networking.communication.client.EndPoint}.
 * This allows reusing {@link Client} and therefore this class only implements accepting clients
 * in an accept - loop.
 *
 * The server - side clients are given a protocol that is compatible with the client - side client
 * protocol, i.e. these protocols are "inverse", which again means that they do not result in
 * deadlocks and perfectly fit each other's messages.
 *
 * Because {@link Client} is used by this class, the implementation for communication can vary from
 * using network sockets to file - mappings etc.
 *
 * This class should NEVER be instantiated by calling the constructor. Rather use {@link CommunicationFactory#createServer()}
 * to get an instance of this class.
